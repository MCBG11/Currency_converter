Hi everyone, in this project I have made an app purposed by aluracourses where you can convert money from certaint currency to another. 
to use it you should run Principal class (main) and enter one of the menu options from 1 to 7:

Then just wait for the result. 

Would like to add I used Exchangerate-api as rate convertor source , "Coin" class as a record for manage Json, "Menu" as the class for interact with users and 
"CurrecyQuery" for interact wih the API . 

Next, there is an example of how it worrks;
